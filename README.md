# ChartsTeardown
Teardown of charts in TradeRepublic App

## This is the compound project to [this blogpost](https://anerma.de/blog/tear-down-trade-republic-charts).
I wanted to know how [TradeRepublic](https://www.traderepublic.com) made their charts and so I replicated it.

**Original:**<br>

**Replicated:**<br>

I came real close and even was able to improve the original, my key takeaways are:
* A chart is nothing more than scaled points connected by a line.
* Using a `CABasicAnimation` to morph a `CGPath` is very smooth. By doing so almost the entire animation comes for free.
* The animation benefits a lot from start drawing the chart from the right combined with proportional numbers of points.
* Interaction can be broken down into three steps. The most complicated part is to get the point next to the users finger and even that is straight foreward.
* Accessibility is nothing that takes care of itself! This entire demo is missing accessibility adjustments in order to focus on the main visuals.
* UIKit and CoreAnimation are just awsome frameworks ðŸ’¯
